## üõ†Ô∏è Data Science Piscine ‚Äì 42

This repo contains my solutions for the **42 Data Science Piscine**.

Each folder represents a module with its own steps and scripts to clean, prepare, and process data using **PostgreSQL** and **bash scripting**.
I‚Äôm not uploading the csv files for security (and storage) reasons, so please, make sure to place them in the correct route (X_ModuleDir/csv_files/).

- [Module 2 ‚Äì Data Analyst](#Module-1---data-analyst)

### Module 0 - Data Engineer

In this first module we focus on the basics of Data Engineering: setting up a PostgreSQL environment, and preparing raw data from CSV files to make it ready for analysis.

### üöÄ What‚Äôs included

- **ex00 & ex01**: Create database, user and connect via `psql` and `pgAdmin`.
- **ex02 / ex03 / ex04**: Create SQL tables from CSVs using different data types.

If you‚Äôre not using pgAdmin, you can use:

```bash
\dt                    # list all tables
\d <table_name>       # show structure of a table
SELECT * FROM <table_name> LIMIT 10;  # show a few rows
```

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to run

Use Docker Compose if you don‚Äôt have PostgreSQL installed locally.

Each exercise includes a `Makefile` and an entrypoint that runs the script automatically.

### Module 1 - Data Warehouse

In this module, we clean and combine raw CSV data to build a small warehouse using PostgreSQL.

### üöÄ What‚Äôs included

- **ex01**: Merge all monthly `customer` CSVs into a single `customers` table.
- **ex02**: Remove duplicate rows (including near-duplicates within ‚â§1s).
- **ex03**: Enrich `customers` by joining it with product info from `items.csv`.

(ex00 is not included as is the same as module 0 ex01)

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to run

You can use the provided Docker Compose to run Postgres and pgAdmin.
As in this module each exercise is one step further than the previous one, this time, I made a common docker-compose so you can run each script manually.

---

### Module 2 ‚Äì Data Analyst

In this module, we focus on generating visual insights from our PostgreSQL warehouse. Using Python (pandas, matplotlib), we query data and produce different types of business-oriented charts to better understand customer behavior.

### üöÄ What‚Äôs included

- **ex00:** Generates a pie chart showing the distribution of purchases by event type.
- **ex01**
    - Line chart: Number of customers per day.
    - Bar chart: Total monthly sales (in ‚Ç≥ million).
    - Area chart: Average amount spent per customer per day.
- **ex02**:
    - Prints the global average ticket per purchase.
    - Creates 3 boxplots comparing customer spending by product category, by month, etc.
- **ex03**: Applies the Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of customer clusters using KMeans, to support targeted email marketing.

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to run

All scripts are designed to run inside the existing Docker environment. You can execute them manually from the container:

```bash
docker exec -it <container_name> python3 scripts/module2/<script_name>.py

```

Each script saves its output chart(s) in `scripts/module2/`. Make sure your database is populated before running them.
